## **Problem Statement:**

Big Mart is a retail store chain that sells various products across different cities. The company is seeking to enhance its sales forecasting accuracy to optimize inventory management, marketing strategies, and operational decisions. The sales data includes information about various items, stores, and sales over a period.

### Goal:
The goal is to build a predictive model that can forecast the sales for each product at a particular store. This will help Big Mart make better stocking decisions, reduce wastage, and maximize profit margins.

### Problem Definition:
- The objective is to **predict the sales of products** in different Big Mart stores based on certain factors such as item characteristics (e.g., type, weight, visibility), store details (e.g., location, size), and historical sales data.
- The model will need to estimate **Item Outlet Sales** (total sales per product) for each item-store combination based on the given features.

### Business Implications:
Accurate sales predictions will allow Big Mart to:
1. **Optimize inventory management**: Ensuring that high-demand products are always in stock and minimizing excess inventory.
2. **Increase profit margins**: By reducing costs associated with overstocking or understocking.
3. **Improve customer satisfaction**: Ensure products are available when and where they are needed.
4. **Guide marketing and promotions**: By understanding which products are likely to perform well, the company can focus on targeted promotions.

### Dataset Details:
- **Item features**: Item Identifier, Item Weight, Item Fat Content, Item Visibility, Item Type, Item MRP (price).
- **Store features**: Outlet Identifier, Outlet Size, Outlet Location Type, Outlet Type (supermarket or grocery store), Outlet Establishment Year.
- **Target**: Item Outlet Sales (the total sales of each product in each store).
